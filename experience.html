            - Automates Daily Jira Tickets
            (Python Selenium WebDriver)
            Every day when entering, a tick had to be
            made and the items of that day were
            recorded, which I wrote in Python code
            and converted to an exe file so that the
            ticket could be created automatically
            just by running it.(<a href="Jira.html">Videos of work output</a>)

            - Unfortunately, it is not possible to describe
            most of the tasks at the request of the
            company and due to
            the commitment I signed.
